The material here are training, workshop, and promotional material for you to host your own events either during the official week (February 27 -- March 2), or anytime you wish to run workshops related to data that is at risk of being lost, repressed, or neglected. 

All of the training material here is provided by the community and you should feel free to reach out to workshop creators, submit your own workshops, submit pull requests to existing workshops, or reach out to the [Open Project Leads](#open-project-leads) with any questions. 

This year, Endangered Data Week is part of [Mozilla's Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/)! Come join us for two days, May 10-11, 2018, from 9am-5pm.

## What is Endangered Data Week?

[Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org) is an annual, collaborative effort, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions, to shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. The week's events promote care for threatened data by: 

*   publicizing the availability of datasets
*   increasing critical engagement with them, including through visualization and analysis
*   encouraging political activism for open data policies and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation.
