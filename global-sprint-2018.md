Hello! ðŸ‘‹ We're thrilled that you're interested in this year's Global Sprint to contribute to [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org)'s curricula!

## What is the Global Sprint?

[Mozilla's Global Sprint](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) is a two-day collaborative hackathon bringing together a diverse network of educators, engineers, artists, scientists, and many others in person and online to build projects for a healthy Internet.

As part of a global movement to make the Internet better, safer, and healthier, educators are creating games that explore online privacy and digital citizenship. Scientists are sharing data online to speed the discovery of new medical treatments. Coders are building smartphone apps to prevent gender-based violence. All this (and much more) is happening in the openâ€”so anyone can watch this work evolve, build on shared knowledge, and pitch in to help out. 

No matter your skill or background, there are ways for you to contribute! Bring your design or writing skills, expertise in coding, teaching, QA testing, game design, and more. We'll use basic online tools like chat, video conferencing, collaborative editing software, and code/content sharing platforms to work and learn together. Collaborate with partners in the same roomâ€”or on the other side of the world.

## I have a spare thirty minutes. How can I help?

We are identifying areas where we can use help under [this repository's Issues page](https://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/issues).  Look for the issues labeled with `beginner friendly` or `help wanted`, which will identify some of those tasks that are more easily tackled. Some tasks might be:

* **Share your data stories**: Why is publicly available data important to you? What would happen if it disappeared or was neglected?
* **Brainstorm event ideas and collaborators**: What kinds of events could EDW run that it isn't already running? Who else might we involve in EDW?
* **Share your flyers, postcards, stickers, and promotional material**: Did you create resources to help advertise Endangered Data Week? Share those here for others to reuse and remix!

Any issue labeled `mozsprint` are tasks we're addressing during the Sprint.

## I can contribute during one or both days. How can I help?

We are identifying areas where we can use help under [this repository's Issues page](https://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/issues).  Look for the issues labeled with `help wanted`, which will identify those tasks that might require more substantial investment in time or skill. Some tasks might be:

* **Share your workshop material**: Did you run a workshop? Share your handouts, slide decks, and worksheets with us and let others reuse and remix your content for their own events.
* **Develop a new workshop**: Have an idea for a workshop but want help developing it? Let's find collaborators and create something new!

Any issue labeled `mozsprint` are tasks we're addressing during the Sprint.

**Questions or comments**: please email any of the [Project Leads](README.md)!
